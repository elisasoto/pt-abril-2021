## Exercise

This basic project focuses on the practice of React, useState, useEffect and passing props to children components. 

### Clock/StopWatch âŒš

Description of the project:

- The "Crono" Button, presents a time format in 'hh:mm:ss:zzz' and 'start', 'stop' y 'split' appear.
- The "Clock" Button, presents time in 'hh:mm:ss' format and buttons 'start', 'stop' y 'split' disappear.
- Behaviour of Start Button: As the name describes, it activates the "Stopwatch" counting up from cero at the pace of every milisecond. When it is active, button sets change and a "Pause" Button Appears, when its clicked, the Crono Pauses and the button changes Back to "start". 
- Behaviour of Stop Button: on click, it stops the Crono and deactivates play & split buttons, plus, activates the "Clear" button; by Clicking this last one, all records dissapear and Stopwatch resets to 0
- Behaviour of Split Button: it registers the time on the Stopwatch every time it's clicked.

NOTES: While being in the Crono Menu and the Crono is started, if we switch to Clock menu an alert must appear to notify the user the Stopwatch is still running.
